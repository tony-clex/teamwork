      <p>The moment their Habitat for Humanity home was <br>

        daughter, Evelina moved in - even though it was<br>
        Christmas Eve. "We were so excited to start the <br>
        new year in our home," says Gabriela. So excited, <br>
        in fact, that the young family only brought a mattress<br>
         and Christmas tree with them on move-inday.</p>

        Syrian Family's New Life

      <p>In 2012, Mustafa's typical day as a cab driver<br>
     in Syria took an abrupt turn.
        During a routine exchange with a passenger about<br>
         the ongoing war, he made a passing jest about a <br>
         statue of the Syrian president. This offhand remark<br>
          led to his arrest and brutal imprisonment two days later.</p>
